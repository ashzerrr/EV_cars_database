My focus for this project was to develop and refine an electric vehicle (EV) database. My goal was to create a comprehensive repository containing detailed information about various electric vehicles. I concentrated on attributes such as the Year, Make, Model, Vehicle Type, and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility. I chose electric vehicles because they’re becoming increasingly common across the country. It’s important, for many reasons, to store information about existing EVs in an organized database. For example, my database could help the state improve EV infrastructure by making it easy to determine how many EVs are registered in each electric utility zone.

I believe that this database could be valuable to multiple groups. First, there are administrative users, like government officials or law enforcement agencies, who could access sensitive data from tables such as “vehicle” and “location.” For instance, electric utility officials in Washington could view the “electric_utility” table to learn how many vehicles are registered in their service areas without gaining access to other sensitive information.
